# LogisticManagementSystem
 This Java project calculates city distances and transportation costs using Google Maps APIs. It computes air and road distances, estimates costs based on weight, dimensions, priority, and sensitivity, and suggests the fastest or cheapest method. Built with OkHttp and Gson, it handles API errors and user input gracefully.
